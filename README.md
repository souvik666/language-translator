# Pure js-language translator


Hey this is souvik dutta this is a small attempt by me to build language translator it supports 17+ languages.this project is built with help of libretranslate.de and it's purly built with ```js```, the whole project is based on tow parts one getting the users input sending it to libretranslate server and get the response and show it to user as it is,
and this web app also supports speech recognition so users don't need to the type the input by them-self
and the whole process is benign handled by  ```webkitSpeechRecognition ```
